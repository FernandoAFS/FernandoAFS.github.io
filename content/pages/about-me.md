# Let me introduce myself

I'm a daydreamer, a travaler, videogame sucker, ebook reader and a life-long student. From 🇪🇸 and currently living somewhere in the internet 🌐.

I love entrepeneurship, coding, sharing and easing the every day pain of everyday work in development.

I'm specialized in python backend development but also care about devops, system-management, frontend develpment, frontend design and even non coding topics such as project management, entrepeneurship, marketing and so on... Everything that has to do with development as a practice and a business.

Stay around if you like to question conventions and to make the hard and complex feel easy. I adhere to the [suckless philosopy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/) as much as I can although I'm not as cool as these guys and that's.... fine 😞.

If you'd like to contact me just write me an [email](mailto:fernando.andeca@gmail.com).

To stay up to date use [RSS](/index.xml). you can follow me on [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@fernandoAFS) too.

Remember, there is no magic, only code!
